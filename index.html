                    <h3>Tic Tac Toe Mania</h3>
                    <p>A pair of people can play tic tac toe. Playing X and O, respectively, are two players. In a grid of three-by-three, four-by-four, and five-by-five cells, the players alternately place their marks. A player wins the game if they get three marks in any directionâ€”row, column, or diagonally. It aims to provide an engaging experience that fosters cognitive skills, decision-making skills, and consequences.</p>
